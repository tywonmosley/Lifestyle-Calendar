# Lifestyle Calendar Tracker

##  Concept
### Background: 
    Lifestyle Directors and event coordinators have the responsibility of organizing events and special activities for their clients. This necessitates the ability to provide real-time updates and event forecasts. The aim of this project is to develop a web application that simplifies this process, offering a user-friendly interface and generating calendars to aid event tracking.

## MVP Feature Requirements
As an anonymous user, I would like to:
* Create an account for event/admin user only
* Log in to an already-created account
* Add, change, delete events
* Track events and provide details of each event
* Provide a view of the calendar to guest viewers
* Contact event/admin user

## MVP Technical Requirements
    Based on your feature requirements, list out the major technical tasks that will need to be Tech stack:

##
- Back end
    - (Server): Node.js with Express.js
    - Database: PostgreSQL
##
 - Front end:
    - Framework: React
##

- Hosting and deployment:
    - Further research needed for optimal hosting and deployment options.

## Backend:
- Implement user authentication and authorization for event/admin users only.
- Set up RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on events.
- Utilize PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval.
- Ensure data security and integrity through proper validation and error handling.
- Implement logging mechanisms for tracking application activity and errors.

## Frontend:

- Develop a responsive and intuitive user interface using React.
- Integrate with backend API endpoints to fetch and display event data.
- Implement user authentication and session management.
- Provide interactive event management features such as adding, editing, and deleting events.
- Design and implement a calendar view for displaying upcoming events.
